Delaney Glass, Li-Ying Wang, Gayoung Park, Anwesha Pan, Monica Keith, Shane Scaggs, Ben Marwick, & Melanie Martin

This workshop was based on materials prepared by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) and [Dan Quintana](https://www.dsquintana.com/). 

### 1. Finding your way around R and RStudio (DG)
- Check everyone could download and open R & RStudio
- Check version numbers for R (we want 4.0.2)
- A brief tour of the main panes (Console, Files, Environ, text editor, pkgs and help) 
- Have to make sure everyone can make the console work before we move on, e.g. console as a calculator 
- Backup: https://rstudio.cloud/ 

### 2. Starting a new RStudio project & installing R pkgs (DG) 
- Create a new RStudio project because it takes care of working direction (no git)
- `install.packages("blogdown")`
- `blogdown::install_hugo(force = TRUE)`
- `blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic", theme_example = TRUE)`
